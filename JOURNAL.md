backstory: i've been putting off Highway for quite a while, but my friends @Candy and @Danerack got me to actually start so here goes nothing!

i'm currently finishing up the ideas and sketches for hyperion, helios and prometheus (my Highway projects). made the repo and wrote the README.md today.

there are multiple different ways i could connect the modules together: regular wires or pogo pins. the modules have to be able to connect seamlessly while still retaining structural integrity so it doesnt fall apart if i put some thing a little too heavy on it so maybe that with a twist to lock **and** secure with fastener thing to make them usable.

so for each movement module, the main components would be a motor, pogo pins, drive of your choice, a slip ring to maintain electrical connection

i think i could somehow add a toolchanger module kinda like selecting microscope lenses, or i could make it like the Prusa XL multi toolhead 3D printer (an automated toolchanger would be cool)

time spent this session: ~2 hours
