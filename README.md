# prometheus ◣

## what?
prometheus is a completely modular robotic arm designed for maximum extensibility

## why?
most robotic arms out there aren't really modular with the exception of the grippers (yes, even the open-source ones) so i decided to make my own with every module able to be independently replaced 

## features:
- MV for object recognition and search
- 2x USB-C ports for charging and data transfer
- 6x stepper motors for accurate movement
- 2x absolute encoders
- 4x incremental encoders

## modules: (potential)
- cycloidal drive (increase torque x999)
- harmonic drive
- planetary gearbox
- gripper with servo
- electromagnet maybe?
- ai camera! (very cool)
- heat sensing camera
